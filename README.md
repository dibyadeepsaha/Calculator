# Calculator
This is a simple implementation of the ever-useful numeric calculator using the crossroads between HTML and JavaScript. Here, the user is able to enter two integers (this can be increased by modifying the files in the repository) and uses the most basic mathematical operations (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) to create a new integer. Feel free to click on the given link in this repository to see a live demo of the calculator and make any suggestions!
